### What games does it run?

None at the moment.

### When will I be able to run games?

This is a side project, so I don't know.

### Your emulator sucks! Where can I find a decent one?

Mimey is a work in progress. In the meantime [let me help you find
one][emulators].

### Why do you want to build yet another CHIP-8 emulator?

According to a lot of programmers CHIP-8 is the easiest game platform to
emulate and my [GameBoy emulator][mimey] will take some time to complete, so I
just want to have at least one finished emulator in the near future.
